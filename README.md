# Breif
My aim was to create a new resource, I chose "Footballers"

### Run the program
If you have already installed the gems 'sinatra' and 'rack' then just
run 'rackup' in iTerm and the project should work.

However if not, then in Git run
```
gem install sinatra
```
followed by
```
gem install rack
```
Finally,
```
rackup
```
Then go to your browser and in the URL type "localhost:9292"

# Difficulties
 * One of the main problems I had was the syntax errors, many little
 typing errors caused my whole project not to work, so to fix this I referred back to the lab notes and managed to resolve these issues.

# What Im most pleased with
* One of the things I'm most pleased with is with this project it has made me more confident in using ruby and cleared up any doubts I had e.g. on monday I found the topic 'classes' confusing, however now i feel like I have grasped it.
